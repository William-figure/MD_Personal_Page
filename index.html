    <h1>Welcome to MD's Web</h1>
    <p>Hi, I am Margadipah. I am a student graduating from UTS as Masters of IT in Business Information Systems major. Personally, I always have a dream of becoming a web-developer. I love visuals such as images and animation, I also love how some projects from web browsers are so concise and easy to nevigate. I love the file pathway structure within URLs, this allow user to quickly navigate to pages through common English. During my free time, I love to hang out with my friends to places and taking photos from beaches or other attractive places. At the moment, I am still not employed, I am looking forward to some manual jobs which are low in demand of working experiences. Besides, I just started the course for web developement. Before achieving my goal, I am still required to sustain my living.</p>
